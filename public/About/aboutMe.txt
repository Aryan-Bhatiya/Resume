About Me
Hey there! I’m Aryan Bhatiya. I started my journey at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, but soon realized that I wasn’t passionate about what I was studying, so I decided to drop out and follow what truly excites me.

What I'm Into
I’m really into Web Development, Search Engine Optimization (SEO), and anything tech-related. I love exploring how the internet works and how things can be optimized to reach more people and make an impact.

A Little About Me
I’m curious—always wanting to learn and understand more.
I’m energetic—I put my all into what I do, no matter how big or small.
I’m excited and optimistic, always looking forward to new challenges.
I’m always eager to learn something new, whether it’s tech or anything else that sparks my interest.
What’s Next
Right now, I’m looking for some hands-on experience and opportunities to learn more through real projects. If you’re working on something cool or need a passionate person on your team, let’s talk!
